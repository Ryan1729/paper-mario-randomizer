# Paper Mario Randomizer

____

This project began as a port of https://github.com/MrCheeze/paper-mario-randomizer

This project also owes a debt to the information collected together in [the paper mario hacking archive](http://papermariohackingarchive.com/)

In particular [the hex editing page](http://papermariohackingarchive.com/downloads/PM64_Hex.txt) by CrashingThunder was referenced several times.
